  summary: 'Graph Networks as a Universal Machine Learning Framework for Molecules and Crystals '
  description: |
    The MatErials Graph Network (MEGNet) is an implementation of DeepMind's 
    graph networks for universal machine learning in materials science. See 
    <http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemmater.9b01294> for benchmarks
    on prediction errors in a broad array of properties in both molecules and 
    crystals.
